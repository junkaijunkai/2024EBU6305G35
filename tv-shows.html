            <span class="movie-info">(2024)</span>
            <p>This series about love and marriage features one to two narrators per episode, constantly overturning and repositioning the understanding of characters and events through switching narrators, perspectives, and time. This highlights that the world of love has always been like a maze, with multiple versions, leaving those involved puzzled. The series is divided into four parts: divorce, infidelity, mistaken love, and restoration, exploring the situations or doubts each person has experienced: What is love? Why get married? Why cheat? Why divorce? Why seek revenge? How to let go? How to recover? How to stay together until old age? Perhaps, only by daring to confront the ugliness, darkness, and brokenness of human nature can one have a chance to mend a fractured relationship.</p>
