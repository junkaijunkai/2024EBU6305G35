            TITANIC “Titanic” is a classic American romantic disaster film released in 1997, directed, written, co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron.
            The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic during 
            its maiden voyage. The story follows the love story of Jack and Rose, who come from completely different worlds. He is a penniless artist, while 
            she is an aristocrat. As the ship sinks after hitting an iceberg, their love faces a severe test. The film also highlights the inequality and class 
            differences of the early 20th century, as well as the bravery and cowardice shown by the passengers and crew during the disaster. With its stunning
            visual effects, powerful performances, and memorable music, “Titanic” won 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and became
            one of the highest-grossing films of all time.

            "The Godfather Part III" is a 1990 American crime film directed and written by Francis Ford Coppola, and the final installment in "The Godfather" trilogy.
            The film stars Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Andy García. It continues the story of Michael Corleone as he attempts to legitimize his criminal
            empire and seek redemption for his past sins. The film also introduces Vincent Mancini, the illegitimate son of Michael's late brother Sonny, who becomes 
            deeply involved in the family's affairs. Set in the late 1970s and early 1980s, "The Godfather Part III" explores themes of family, legacy, and the consequences
            of a life of crime. While it may not be as critically acclaimed as its predecessors, the film offers a compelling conclusion to the Corleone saga and features 
            strong performances from its cast. "The Godfather Part III" received seven Academy Award nominations and remains an important chapter in the iconic film series.
