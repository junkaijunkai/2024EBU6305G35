                    This film is based on the debut novel "Five Point Someone" by Indian best-selling author Chetan Bhagat. Fran (Madhavan), Radu (Sharman Joshi), and Rancho (Aamir Khan) are students at the Royal Engineering College, roommates, and best friends. In a strict college environment, Rancho stands out as a very different student. He challenges the teaching methods of the principal, Virus (Boman Irani), openly. Rancho not only encourages Fran and Radu to bravely pursue their dreams but also persuades the principal's second daughter, Pia (Kareena Kapoor), to leave her copper-smelling fiancé. Rancho's unconventional approach leads to conflicts with model student "Silencer" (Omi Vaidya) and a pact to meet ten years later to determine whose lifestyle is more successful.</p>

                    The United States in the 1920s faces economic depression, high unemployment rates, and exploitation of workers, who become mere cogs in the machinery of large-scale production. Charlie (Charlie Chaplin) is one such downtrodden citizen, working tirelessly in a noisy factory to earn a meager income. The repetitive and exhausting work leaves him breathless, leading to absurd situations where he tightens people's noses as if they were screws and gets entangled in the machinery. Despite his poverty, Charlie is kind-hearted. He saves a homeless girl and lives with her, creating a modest but cozy home. Each time penniless Charlie seeks food, he intentionally commits petty crimes to enter jail for a meal. Things seem to improve momentarily when the homeless girl becomes a star, but the happiness is short-lived.</p>

                    "Pulp Fiction" consists of three interrelated stories: "Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife," "The Gold Watch," and "The Bonnie Situation," along with the prologue and epilogue. Although seemingly independent, these stories are intricately connected.
                   In one story, thieves "Pumpkin" and "Honey Bunny" attempt to rob a diner but encounter unexpected challenges when hitmen Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) happen to be dining there. Will the hitmen spare the two robbers?
                   Vincent, a henchman for crime boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), is tasked with escorting Marsellus' wife for a night. Despite knowing the dire consequences, Vincent faces temptation from Marsellus' wife, Mia.
                   Vincent's story continues when boxer Butch (Bruce Willis) enters the scene, altering his life forever. Butch possesses a family heirloom, a gold watch, which leads to a shameful secret shared between him and Marsellus due to the watch.</p>
