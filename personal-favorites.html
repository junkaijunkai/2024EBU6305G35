            “Titanic” is a classic American romantic disaster film released in 1997, directed, written,
            co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron.
            The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love
            aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic during
            its maiden voyage. The story follows the love story of Jack and Rose, who come from completely different
            worlds. He is a penniless artist, while
            she is an aristocrat. As the ship sinks after hitting an iceberg, their love faces a severe test. The film
            also highlights the inequality and class
            differences of the early 20th century, as well as the bravery and cowardice shown by the passengers and crew
            during the disaster. With its stunning
            visual effects, powerful performances, and memorable music, “Titanic” won 11 Academy Awards, including Best
            Picture and Best Director, and became
            one of the highest-grossing films of all time.

            “The Godfather” is a groundbreaking American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the
            1969 novel of the same name by Mario Puzo.
            Released in 1972, the film stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton. It
            tells the story of the Corleone family,
            a powerful Italian-American crime syndicate based in New York City, and their struggle to maintain their
            position in the underworld while dealing
            with both internal and external threats. With its compelling narrative, stunning performances, and iconic
            score, “The Godfather” is widely regarded
            as one of the greatest films in cinematic history. It won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and
            has had a lasting impact on popular culture.

            "The Godfather Part III" is a 1990 American crime film directed and written by Francis Ford Coppola, and the
            final installment in "The Godfather" trilogy.
            The film stars Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Andy García. It continues the story of Michael
            Corleone as he attempts to legitimize his criminal
            empire and seek redemption for his past sins. The film also introduces Vincent Mancini, the illegitimate son
            of Michael's late brother Sonny, who becomes
            deeply involved in the family's affairs. Set in the late 1970s and early 1980s, "The Godfather Part III"
            explores themes of family, legacy, and the consequences
            of a life of crime. While it may not be as critically acclaimed as its predecessors, the film offers a
            compelling conclusion to the Corleone saga and features
            strong performances from its cast. "The Godfather Part III" received seven Academy Award nominations and
            remains an important chapter in the iconic film series.
